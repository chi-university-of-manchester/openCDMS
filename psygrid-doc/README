PsyGrid Documentation
---------------------

PsyGrid Documentation is now maintained in DocBook format - this is an xml 
schema designed for software documentation. The benefit of using
DocBook is that the documentation can be written once and then 
transformed from this single source into a variety of different
formats, suitable for different applications.


Files
-----

The DocBook source files are held in the src folder. There is an xml file 
for each chapter of the documentation, plus a main file which brings
all of the chapters together:

psygrid.xml = the main file, contains the introduction and support
chapters and includes the files for the other chapters
install.xml = installation chapter
cocoa.xml = CoCoA chapter
security.xml = Security Manager chapter
dsd.xml = Dataset Designer chapter
web.xml = PsyGrid Web chapter

The images folder contains all screenshot and other image files.


DocBook editor
--------------

It's just XML so you can use whatever editor you want, but I have been getting
on pretty well with XMLmind's XML Editor (http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/). The
personal edition is a free download for non-commercial use.

The good thing about XXE are that the DocBook schema is built in, so it will only
allow you to insert valid tags. It also has a stylesheet built in so you can see
a rendered view of your DocBook source.

For editing I have generally been using the "View - no style sheet" option which gives
a tree view of the XML document. Then to see how it's going to look I switch to 
"View - DocBook". Anything over simple text editing I found hard to do in this view 
as it is hard to select the correct part of the underlying XML. 


DocBook Quick Start
-------------------

DocBook is a very rich schema but (rightly or wrongly) I've only used
a small subset of the tags so far.

Here are some useful web resources:

http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/DocBookTutorials

Some common scenarios:

Sections - use the section tag; the first tag inside the section should be
a title.

General Text - will be in para tags i.e. paragraphs. In XXE if you are in a para
and want to go to a new para just hit return and it will do it automatically.

Lists - itemizedlist for bullet points and orderedlist for numbers. Each item 
in a list is a listitem, listitems then contain para and other tags.

Bold/Italics - wrap the relevant text in emphasis tags and set the role attribute
to bold or italics (to do this in XXE select the text and then use "Convert [wrap]"
to wrap it in emphasis tags)

Figures - I've been using "Figure (screenshot)" in XXE which creates a figure
containing all the other necessary tags. All you need to complete is the title
and the fileref attribute of imagedata.

Tables - you basically form these the same way as you would HTML tables

References - to reference something (say a section or a figure) you need to complete 
the id attribute of what you want to reference, then add an xref tag with the linkend
attribute the same as this id.

Web Links - use the ulink tag.

Code - use programlisting


Taking Screenshots
------------------

I've been scaling down screenshots to be no wider than 450px. Also, I had some problems
with the PDF output doing weird things to some screenshots (zooming in on them massively).
This turned out to be because the images had funny resolutions like 2.7 pixels/mm. Once
I changed them to 72 or 96 pixels/in (used Gimp to do this, Image - Scale Image) all was 
well. 

Also, if you resize images to make them smaller it is worth sharpening them up a bit - I
use Filters - Enhance - Sharpen with a Sharpness of 20.


Transforming the DocBook source
-------------------------------

There are ant tasks to transform to the following formats:

JavaHelp - this is the default task so just type "ant" or "ant docbook2javahelp"
HTML - ant docbook2html
PDF - ant docbook2pdf
