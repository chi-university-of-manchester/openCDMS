/**
    Implementation of a <b>randomX</b>-compliant class using the
    "Minimal Standard" multiplicative congruential generator of Park
    and Miller.  [Park, S.K. and K.W. Miller, <cite>Communications of
    the ACM</cite> <b>31</b>, 1192-1201 (1988).]

    <p>
    The generation algorithm is:

    <p>
    <center>
        <em>I<sub>j+1</sub></em> = (<em>I<sub>j</sub></em> ï¿½ 16807) & 0x7FFFFFFF
    </center>

    <p>
    Note that the intermediate value of the multiplication by 16807
    (7<sup>5</sup>) exceeds that representable in 32 bits; this has
    deterred use of this generator in most portable languages.
    Fortunately, Java's <tt>long</tt> type is guaranteed to be
    64 bits, so a straightforward and portable implementation is
    possible.

    <p>
    Designed and implemented in July 1996 by
    <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/">John Walker</a>
