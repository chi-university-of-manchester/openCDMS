When used, when each document is completed it is committed straight to the repository, and you no longer have to do a separate commit step.\n\nWe believe that "always-online" mode will be suitable for almost all openCDMS users; the benefits are (a) no need to remember to do commits, (b) data entered is more secure and less liable to corruption, and (c) reports generated from the repository are more up-to-date.\n\nDocuments may still be edited after being saved as a separate step is now required to move them to the Pending Approval status (after which changes can only be made after a document is Rejected).\n\nThe original "online-and-offline" mode is still available but should only be used when really needed e.g. you use a laptop for data entry and only have an intermittent network connection. To switch back to "online-and-offline" mode please use the Options - Settings menu. For more details, please see the user documentation and release notes.
